## OpenStack specific settings and flavours

### OpenStack network name with external access and a router attached (subnet associated), find it in horizon Network -> Networks.
### This is normally a private network.
export TF_VAR_network_name="your_private_net"
export TF_VAR_external_net="your-external-network-id"
### Your choice of dns_nameservers (an array)
export TF_VAR_dns_nameservers='["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"]'
### OpenStack public network from where the floating IPs are drawn from.
export TF_VAR_floatingip_pool="your_ext_net"
### Flavours for the different machines, normally the IDs shown in glance list-flavours or shown on Horizon when aiming to launch an instance.
### This will define the amount of RAM, CPU and disk of each machine.

### Cluster layout (how many masters, how many nodes, etc).
### For HA you need at least 3 masters. By default, our masters are tainted not to act as nodes, so it should be safe to keep etcd
